<!-- ##### SECTION Title ##### -->
AtkDocument

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
The ATK interface which represents the toplevel container for document content.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
The AtkDocument interface should be supported by any object whose content is a 
representation or view of a document.  The AtkDocument interface should appear
on the toplevel container for the document content; however AtkDocument 
instances may be nested (i.e. an AtkDocument may be a descendant of another
AtkDocument) in those cases where one document contains "embedded content" 
which can reasonably be considered a document in its own right.

<!-- ##### SIGNAL AtkDocument::load-complete ##### -->
<para>
The 'load-complete' signal is emitted when a pending load of a static
document has completed.  This signal is to be expected by ATK clients 
if and when AtkDocument implementors expose ATK_STATE_BUSY.  If the state
of an AtkObject which implements AtkDocument does not include ATK_STATE_BUSY,
it should be safe for clients to assume that the AtkDocument's static contents
are fully loaded into the container.  (Dynamic document contents should
be exposed via other signals.)
</para>

@atkdocument: the object which received the signal.

<!-- ##### SIGNAL AtkDocument::load-stopped ##### -->
<para>
The 'load-stopped' signal is emitted when a pending load of document contents
is cancelled, paused, or otherwise interrupted by the user or application 
logic.  It should not however be
emitted while waiting for a resource (for instance while blocking on a file or 
network read) unless a user-significant timeout has occurred.
</para>

@atkdocument: the object which received the signal.

<!-- ##### SIGNAL AtkDocument::reload ##### -->
<para>
The 'reload' signal is emitted when the contents of a document is refreshed
from its source.  Once 'reload' has been emitted, a matching 'load-complete' 
or 'load-stopped' signal should follow, which clients may await before 
interrogating ATK for the latest document content.
</para>

@atkdocument: the object which received the signal.
