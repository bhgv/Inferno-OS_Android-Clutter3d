AtkHypertext

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
The ATK interface which provides standard mechanism for manipulating hyperlinks.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
An interface used for objects which implement linking between multiple
resource or content locations, or multiple 'markers' within a single
document.  A Hypertext instance is associated with one or more Hyperlinks,
which are associated with particular offsets within the Hypertext's included
content.  While this interface is derived from Text, there is no requirement that Hypertext instances have textual content; they may implement Image as well, and Hyperlinks need not have non-zero text offsets.
