Cogl does not distribute a static Changelog with releases because we feel that
the Git log does a better job of tracking all the detailed source code changes
that are made to Cogl.

If you just want a high level overview of what has changed between Cogl
releases then please see the NEWS file that we distribute.

You can clone Cogl via Git using:

$ git clone git://git.gnome.org/cogl.git

You can see the log using:

$ git log

Or you can look at the log for a particular release by specifying
a release tag name like:

$ git log 1.7.2
