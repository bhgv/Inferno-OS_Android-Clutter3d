DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cogl is a small open source library for using 3D graphics hardware for
rendering. The API departs from the flat state machine style of OpenGL and is
designed to make it easy to write orthogonal components that can render without
stepping on each others toes.

As well as aiming for a nice API, we think having a single library as opposed
to an API specification like OpenGL has a few advantages too; like being
able to paper over the inconsistencies/bugs of different OpenGL
implementations in a centralized place, not to mention the myriad of OpenGL
extensions. It also means we are in a better position to provide utility
APIs that help software developers since they only need to be implemented
once and there is no risk of inconsistency between implementations.

Having other backends, besides OpenGL, such as drm, Gallium or D3D are
options we are interested in for the future.

REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cogl currently only requires:

  • GLib ≥ @GLIB_REQ_VERSION@
  • OpenGL ≥ 1.3 (or 1.2 + multitexturing), or OpenGL ES 2.0 (or 1.1)
  • GLX, AGL, WGL or an EGL implementation

Cogl also has optional dependencies:

  • GDK-Pixbuf ≥ @GDK_PIXBUF_REQ_VERSION@
     - for image loading
  • Cairo ≥ @CAIRO_REQ_VERSION@
     - for debugging texture atlasing (debug builds only)

The optional Cogl Pango library requires:
  • Cairo ≥ @CAIRO_REQ_VERSION@
  • PangoCairo ≥ @PANGOCAIRO_REQ_VERSION@

On X11, Cogl depends on the following extensions

  • XComposite ≥ @XCOMPOSITE_REQ_VERSION@
  • XDamage
  • XExt
  • XFixes ≥ @XFIXES_REQ_VERSION@

For the Wayland backend, Cogl requires:
  • Wayland ≥ @WAYLAND_REQ_VERSION@

When running with OpenGL, Cogl requires at least version 1.3
or 1.2 with the multitexturing extension. However to build Cogl
you will need the latest GL headers which can be obtained from:

  http://www.khronos.org

If you are building the API reference you will also need:

  • GTK-Doc ≥ @GTK_DOC_REQ_VERSION@

If you are building the additional documentation you will also need:

  • xsltproc
  • jw (optional, for generating PDFs)

If you are building the Introspection data you will also need:

  • GObject-Introspection ≥ @GI_REQ_VERSION@

GObject-Introspection is available from:

  git://git.gnome.org/gobject-introspection

If you want support for profiling Cogl you will also need:

  • UProf ≥ @UPROF_REQ_VERSION@

UProf is available from:

  git://github.com/rib/UProf.git

DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 1.x stable API is documented here:

  http://developer.gnome.org/cogl/stable/

The 1.x development API is documented here:

  http://developer.gnome.org/cogl/1.$(COGL_1_MINOR_VERSION)

The experimental 2.0 API is currently not hosted online but can be built
by passing the --enable-gtk-doc option to ./configure when building
and the documentation can then be found under
doc/reference/cogl-2.0-experimental/html/index.html

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please refer to the INSTALL document.

--
BUGS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please report bugs here:

  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=cogl

You will need a Bugzilla account.

Please include the following in bug reports:

  • what system you're running Cogl on;
  • which version of Cogl you are using;
  • which version of GLib and OpenGL (or OpenGL ES) you are using;
  • which video card and which drivers you are using, including output of
    glxinfo and xdpyinfo (if applicable);
  • how to reproduce the bug.

If you cannot reproduce the bug with one of the tests that come with
Cogl's source code, it can help a lot to include a small test case
displaying the bad behaviour.

If the bug exposes a crash, the exact text printed out and a stack trace
obtained using gdb are greatly appreciated.

CONTRIBUTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CODING_STYLE file describes the coding style we use throughout Cogl,
please try your best to conform to this style because the consistency
really helps keep the code maintainable.

We can accept contributions in several ways:
  • Either as patches attached to bugs on bugzilla
      - For this you may be interested in using git-bz.

        See http://git.fishsoup.net/man/git-bz.html for details
  • You can email us patches
      - For this we recommend using git-send-email

  • You can create a remote branch and ask us to pull from that for more
    substantial changes.
      - For this we recommend using github.

Ideally standalone patches should be created using git format-patch since
that makes it easiest to import the patch with a commit message into a
git repository.
