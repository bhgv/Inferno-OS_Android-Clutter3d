/**
 * SECTION:cogl-error
 * @short_description: A way for Cogl to throw exceptions
 *
 * As a general rule Cogl shields non-recoverable errors from
 * developers, such as most heap allocation failures (unless for
 * exceptionally large resources which we might reasonably expect to
 * fail) and this reduces the burden on developers.
 *
 * There are some Cogl apis though that can fail for exceptional
 * reasons that can also potentially be recovered from at runtime
 * and for these apis we use a standard convention for reporting
 * runtime recoverable errors.
 *
 * As an example if we look at the cogl_context_new() api which
 * takes an error argument:
 * |[
 *   CoglContext *
 *   cogl_context_new (CoglDisplay *display, CoglError **error);
 * ]|
 *
 * A caller interested in catching any runtime error when creating a
 * new #CoglContext would pass the address of a #CoglError pointer
 * that has first been initialized to %NULL as follows:
 *
 * |[
 *   CoglError *error = NULL;
 *   CoglContext *context;
 *
 *   context = cogl_context_new (NULL, &error);
 * ]|
 *
 * The return status should usually be enough to determine if there
 * was an error set (in this example we can check if context == %NULL)
 * but if it's not possible to tell from the function's return status
 * you can instead look directly at the error pointer which you
 * initialized to %NULL. In this example we now check the error,
 * report any error to the user, free the error and then simply
 * abort without attempting to recover.
 *
 * |[
 *   if (context == NULL)
 *     {
 *       fprintf (stderr, "Failed to create a Cogl context: %s\n",
 *                error->message);
 *       cogl_error_free (error);
 *       abort ();
 *     }
 * ]|
 *
 * All Cogl APIs that accept an error argument can also be passed a
 * %NULL pointer. In this case if an exceptional error condition is hit
 * then Cogl will simply log the error message and abort the
 * application. This can be compared to language execeptions where the
 * developer has not attempted to catch the exception. This means the
 * above example is essentially redundant because it's what Cogl would
 * have done automatically and so, similarly, if your application has
 * no way to recover from a particular error you might just as well
 * pass a %NULL #CoglError pointer to save a bit of typing.
 *
 * <note>If you are used to using the GLib API you will probably
 * recognize that #CoglError is just like a #GError. In fact if Cogl
 * has been built with --enable-glib then it is safe to cast a
 * #CoglError to a #GError.</note>
 *
 * <note>An important detail to be aware of if you are used to using
 * GLib's GError API is that Cogl deviates from the GLib GError
 * conventions in one noteable way which is that a %NULL error pointer
 * does not mean you want to ignore the details of an error, it means
 * you are not trying to catch any exceptional errors the function might
 * throw which will result in the program aborting with a log message
 * if an error is thrown.</note>
