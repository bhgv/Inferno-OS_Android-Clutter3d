 * SECTION:cogl-primitive-texture
 * @short_description: Interface for low-level textures like
 *                     #CoglTexture2D and #CoglTexture3D.
 *
 * A #CoglPrimitiveTexture is a texture that is directly represented
 * by a single texture on the GPU. For example these could be a
 * #CoglTexture2D, #CoglTexture3D or #CoglTextureRectangle. This is
 * opposed to high level meta textures which may be composed of
 * multiple primitive textures or a sub-region of another texture such
 * as #CoglAtlasTexture and #CoglTexture2DSliced.
 *
 * A texture that implements this interface can be directly used with
 * the attributes API such as cogl_framebuffer_draw_attributes().
 * Other types of textures need to be first resolved to primitive
 * textures using the #CoglMetaTexture interface.
 *
 * <note>Most developers won't need to use this interface directly but
 * still it is worth understanding the distinction between high-level
 * and primitive textures because you may find other references in the
 * documentation that detail limitations of using
 * primitive textures.</note>
