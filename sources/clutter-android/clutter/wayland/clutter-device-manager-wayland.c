   * To be consistent with other clutter backends though we only associate the
   * device manager with the backend when _clutter_events_wayland_init() is
   * called in _clutter_backend_init_events(). This should still allow the
   * runtime selection of an alternative input backend if desired and in that
   * case the wayland device manager will be benign.
   *
   * FIXME: At some point we could perhaps collapse the
   * _clutter_backend_post_parse(), and _clutter_backend_init_events()
   * functions into one called something like _clutter_backend_init() which
   * would allow the real backend to manage the precise order of
   * initialization.
