               * typically NorthWest not SouthWest.
               *
               * This means if you grow a window vertically the server
               * will make sure to place the old contents of the window
               * at the top-left/north-west of your new larger window, but
               * that may happen asynchronous to GLX preparing to do a
               * blit specified relative to the bottom-left/south-west of
               * the window (based on the old smaller window geometry).
               *
               * When the GLX issued blit finally happens relative to the
               * new bottom of your window, the destination will have
               * shifted relative to the top-left where all the pixels you
               * care about are so it will result in a nasty artefact
               * making resizing look very ugly!
               *
               * We can't currently fix this completely, in-part because
               * the window manager tends to trample any gravity we might
               * set.  This workaround instead simply disables blits for a
               * while if we are notified of any resizes happening so if
               * the user is resizing a window via the window manager then
               * they may see an artefact for one frame but then we will
